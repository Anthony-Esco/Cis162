    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Anthony and I am majoring in computer science with this being my second year at Cerritos College.
        My current college goals are to transfer to a four-year university in order to obtain my bachelors degree in computer science, and afterwards I intend to obtain my masters.
        I do not have any experience in HTML or CSS but I do have a bit of experience with LaTeX which is also a document markup language.
        My goals for this course include familiarizing myself with HTML and CSS in order to develop Web pages as I want to eventually become a full stack developer and so I believe that this course will
        help me in pursuing that goal as web page development is an important step in the process. I am excited to take this course!
